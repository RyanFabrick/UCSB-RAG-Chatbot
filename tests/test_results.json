Students gain both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience through projects, preparing them for a wide range of careers in industry.\n\nThe MSME and PhDME programs build upon this foundation, delving into more advanced topics such as robotics, micro-machines, machine learning, and dynamical systems and control.  These graduate programs are designed to push the boundaries of the field and prepare students for careers in academia, government laboratories, and advanced roles within industry.  Both programs equip students to solve complex problems and design innovative solutions.\n",
